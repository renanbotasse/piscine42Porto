# 42 Piscine - Porto
<p align="justify">
42 School is a global education initiative that offers a unique and innovative approach to learning technology. Rather than traditional classrooms and teachers, the students learn through peer-to-peer. This method helps the students to develop both computing and life skills, which is essential for becoming a professional in the tech industry.
</p>
<p align="justify">
To gain admission to 42, I had to go through a highly competitive selection process. The final stage of the selection process is called the "C Piscine," which is a 26-day C programming bootcamp that challenges my skills to the max.
</p>
<p align="justify">
During the C Piscine, I've been learning both hard and soft skills. The hard skills include C programming, where I work with variables, pointers, memory allocation, macros, and libraries. I've also learned shell commands and how to use Git to submit my projects.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The soft skills I'm developing are just as essential as the hard skills. Self-learning and proactiveness are the core of our methodology, and we rely on empirical knowledge, googling, and asking our classmates to learn at our own pace. Teamwork is another crucial aspect of the program. On weekends, we work on a 48-hour project called "Rush," where I collaborate with a randomly selected team of three members. The major challenge is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.
</p>
<p align="justify">
One of the most exciting things about 42 is that the school is open 24/7, and we can work whenever we want. This freedom demands excellent time management skills and resiliency.
